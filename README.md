## Exercise 1

Exercise 1 can be seen in /exercise-1/exercise-1.js.

Note - In production I would have rewritten this whole thing more, including improving the names; I tried to keep this close to the original for the sake of making clear the comparisons.

To test (using mocha), first run `npm i`, then `npm run test`.

## Exercise 2

For Exercise 2, you can go to /exercise-2 and see the exercise-2.html, which uses the style.css
